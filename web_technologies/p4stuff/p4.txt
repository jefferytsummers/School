turnin code:  awt_p4


Using the multimedia files provided with this description, create an
interface to a multimedia (text, images, videos, sounds) library system.
As in the demo in class, you setup should sections for each of Maya and
Unity3D.  The web interface should provide access using the summary/details
capabilities of html5.  When links to displayable items are displayed, they
should slightly expand/pop-out as in the demo.  Each item will be viewable
(e.g. play a video), and each item should be downloadable.  Controls should
be available when appropirate.

Also like the demo, a drag-and-drop section should be available for uploads
as well as a button for file selection for upload.  Uploaded files should
be placed into a sub-dir named "uploads".  The contents of that directory
may be deleted before testing.


Use turnin to submit a tar file containing all files for the project.

p4 will be graded on www.cs.mtsu.edu in this manner:
    python3 -m http.server --cgi 5994 &   ## where 5994 is a port I choose

    in chrome on another computer, visit:
        http://www.cs.mtsu.edu:5994

    When I visit that URL, there should be a file there named p4.html
    which I will select to load into the browser.
