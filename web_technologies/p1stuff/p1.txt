                                   Project 1


turnin code:  awt_p1


This project will use html5 and css (with media queries); it will NOT
use javascript.

Create a responsive web page using the grid and/or flexbox models.
It should operate as the demo shown in class, i.e. support three
configurations based on page size:
        - 750px
        750px +
        1000px +

There are 3 *.png files in the public directory that show basic layout
at each size.  Configuration should handle both arrangement inside the
bordered container, as well as relative sizes of the components, as in
the demo.


Use turnin to submit a tar file containing all files for the project.

p1 will be graded on www.cs.mtsu.edu in this manner:
    python3 -m http.server --cgi 5994 &   ## where 5994 is a port I choose

    in chrome on another computer, visit:
        http://www.cs.mtsu.edu:5994

    When I visit that URL, there should be a file there named p1.html
    which I will select to load into the browser.

This is the basic technique which we will use for almost all projects this
semester.
