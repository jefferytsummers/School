turnin code: awt_p2


This project will use javascript in addition to html5 and css3.

We will build one version of a single-page application (SPA). In this
version, we do not keep track of "fake" URLs onto the page. Instead,
we build an interactive application that resides on a single page.
The project should present an interface similar to that demonstrated
in class for the PlayCanvas Editor. The pc*.png files show the type of
layout that you need to provide, including situations in which various
parts of the interface have been collapsed. HOWEVER, you do not need to
provide all the machinery available on PlayCanvas. Your version can be
simple colored, collapsible sections like shown in the demo*.png files
from the class demo. Also, you do not need to provide the drop-down menu.
As in the demo, the application should remain totally on the page when
resizing down to an 'unreasonable' minimum.

As usual, grid and flexbox are OK; float and clear are not.

You may use the collapse_btn.png file in your project if you choose.


Use turnin to submit a tar file containing all files for the project.

p2 will be graded on www.cs.mtsu.edu in this manner:
    python3 -m http.server --cgi 5994 & ## where 5994 is a port I choose

    in chrome on another computer, visit:
        http://www.cs.mtsu.edu:5994

    When I visit that URL, there should be a file there named p2.html
    which I will select to load into the browser.
