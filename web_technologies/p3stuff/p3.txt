Due March 16

turnin code:  awt_p3


Build a simple, single-user notes-board system using cgi capability to
register notes into a file stored at the server.  The top-level html
page should be named:

    p3.html

That page will have access to code in a cgi-bin directory with it.

Use a css animation to present a "personal" dancing logo at the top of
the page, like the demo in class.  The animation should start immediately
but only play 2 times for 2 seconds each and then stop.

Use session storage to remember the username so a user can post multiple
messages without having to re-type their name every time.  Also, provide
a button to clear the session storage so that the username field will
be blank again.

For testing, in the top-level dir with p3.html, provide a tiny shell
script named:

    reset_msgs.sh

The script will be run this way:

    sh reset_msgs.sh

The script should reset the file where you are storing messages so that
there are only 2 short messages in the file - one from Alice and one
from Bob.


Use turnin to submit a tar file containing all files (including the cgi-bin
sub-dir) for the project.

p3 will be graded on www.cs.mtsu.edu in this manner:
    python3 -m http.server --cgi 5994 &   ## where 5994 is a port I choose

    in chrome on another computer, visit:
        http://www.cs.mtsu.edu:5994

    When I visit that URL, there should be a file there named p3.html
    which I will select to load into the browser.
