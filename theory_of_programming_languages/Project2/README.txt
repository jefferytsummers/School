Where to download Perl IDE:
An IDE for perl can be downloaded at "http://padre.perlide.org/". However, I
just used vim and a linux terminal to write and run my code, respectively. There
are actually two linux commands incorporated into my code, 'clear' and 'wc' to
be precise, so that is one thing to keep in mind when attempting to run this
code.

How to install the IDE or compiler:
To install the IDE mentioned above, one must simply click the Download
button.

How to compile the program:
Perl code does not need to be compiled.

How to execute the program:
type the following, without quotes, into a terminal: 'perl ola2.pl'
