turnin code:  py_p1


Write a python (3.4+) program that uses the dart-throwing algorithm to compute pi.
Count points on the circle as being inside the circle.

I will run the program this way:

    python3 yourpgmname  N

where N is the number of darts to throw.

Print:
    pi estimate = xxxxx

where you replace xxxxx with the computed estimate of pi.

Use turnin to submit only your python source file.
