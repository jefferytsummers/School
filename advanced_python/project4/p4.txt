turnin code: py_p4


Write a python program that computes the number of prime numbers between
specified low and high values, inclusive.  The low and high will be
provided as the first and second command-line arguments; these arguments
will be greater than 2.  Note that you only keep the number of primes
found and not the primes themselves.

The mainline program should NOT perform any of the computation.
Instead, it should use the third command-line argument, an integer,
to tell it how many worker processes to create to compute the results.
The mainline should divide the range of work as evenly as possible among
the worker processes.

Use the Process facility of the multiprocessing module to create the
worker processes.  Use the Queue facility of the multiprocessing module
to retrieve the results from the worker processes.

Use the time.time facility in the mainline to determine the amount of time
between the time that the worker processes are "start"ed and are "join"ed.

Print out the number of primes found followed by the amount of time for
the job on a single line, separated by about 4-8 blanks, and with no
other words or information.

Some simple tests might be:

        ./p4.py 3 103 1
        ./p4.py 3 103 2
        ./p4.py 3 103 3

If those all show 26 primes, then run larger tests.
