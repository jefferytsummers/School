Write a python (3.4+) program that performs simple web scraping.
It should use these python modules to retrieve and process data:
    requests
    bs4 (BeautifulSoup)

The program will sometimes need to use the google maps api to compute
distances between cities.

You can test the google maps api in a browser by visiting a website, e.g.:
    https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/distancematrix/json?origins=murfreesboro,tn&destinations=nashville,tn

Here are some relevant google docs:
    General docs from google are here:
        https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/webservices/
    And specific docs about the distance matrix support are here:
        https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/distancematrix/
            Read Documentation <-- a useful link near the top of the page

Here are the BeautifulSoup bs4 docs:
    https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/

Here are the requests docs:
    http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/

The program should be invokable in 3 different ways:
    python3 p5.py -j city1,state1 city2,state2
    python3 p5.py -x city1,state1 city2,state2
    python3 p5.py -a some_url

If the -j option is used, then the google distancematrix site should
be used requesting json output.  If the -x is used, then the same site
should be used but requesting xml instead.  When json is requested, it
can be processed by methods available in the requests module.  When xml
is requested, it can be processed by using bs4.

Using the -j option in this manner:

    python3 p5.py -j murfreesboro,tn nashville,tn

would produce this output:

    54.8 km  between  murfreesboro,tn and nashville,tn

If the -a is used, then the program should visit the given url and
obtain all links (<a> tags) on the page, and only print out the href
values for each link.

Using the -a option to visit the class syllabus at:

    https://www2.cs.mtsu.edu/~rbutler/courses/py/syllabus.html

would discover and print these hrefs:

  http://www.mtsu.edu/~rbutler
  http://www.mtsu.edu/ucat/
  http://www.mtsu.edu/~csdept/Academics/academicIntegrity.htm
