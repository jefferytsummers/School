turnin code:  py_p3


Write a python3 module named
    p3mod.py
which can be imported and used as in the sample p3rmb.py program.

The module should provide the function named
    find_start_positions
which receives a character string to analyze.  That function *must* be
implemented as a generator which will, on each invocation, return a
tuple of locations in that string which contain a potential start codon.
Potential start codons are 'atg' and 'gtg'.  Input may be in either
upper or lower case.

To test, I will run p3rmb.py multiple times with various inputs.
Each test will import your p3mod.py module.
Each test will be run in this manner:

    python3 p3rmb.py some_input_filename

If the input file contains these lines:

    s1   catgccccgtgaaaa
    stwo ccgtgccccctgaaa

then, the program would print:

    s1 (1, 8)
    stwo (2,)
    s3 ()

Use turnin to submit only your python source file.
